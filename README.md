r# Lyrics-Generation-RNN
This repository contains code for lyrics generation for artists using Recurrent Neural Networks algorithm of machine learning without using any library i.e. sklearn, keras, tensorflow etc.

1) To run the code, these are the steps need to be followed - 

2) The code has the following dependencies, which need to be installed before running this code:
	a) Python, Install version greater than 3.5
	b) Pandas, More details at: https://pandas.pydata.org/
	c) numpy, More details at: https://numpy.org/

3) Execute driver.py file

4) After executing driver.py file, a prompt will come to ask for the input for which artists you want to generate the lyrics. select any artist from the list and provide the number or provide any other number apart from the list to run the code on the global dataset for every artists.

5) Output file will contain the cross entopy loss and generated lyrics in the next line for each 50th iteration.

Note - Since data is to be downloaded from cloud, the pre-processing part of the program will take time.
