Look at her face, it's a wonderful face  
And it means something special to me  
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me  
How lucky can one fellow be?  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?  
  
And when we go for a walk in the park  
And she holds me and squeezes my hand  
We'll go on walking for hours and talking  
About all the things that we plan  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?

Oh please don't let me down  
  
There's a shimmer in your eyes  
Like the feeling of a thousand butterflies  
Please don't talk, go on, play  
Andante, Andante  
And let me float away  
  
I'm your music

I'll never know why I had to go  
Why I had to put up such a lousy rotten show  
Boy, I was tough, packing all my stuff  
Saying I don't need you anymore, I've had enough  
And now, look at me standing here again 'cause I found out that  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
Gotta have you near  
  
As good as new, my love for you  
And keeping it that way is my intention  
As good as new and growing too  
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension  
It's as good as new, my love for you  
Just like it used to be and even better  
As good as new, thank God it's true  
Darling, we were always meant to stay together  
  
Feel like a creep, never felt so cheap  
Never had a notion that my love could be so deep  
How could I make such a dumb mistake  
Now I know I'm not entitled to another break  
But please, baby, I beg you to forgive 'cause I found out that  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
Gotta get you near  
  
I thought that our love was at an end but here I am again  
  
As good as new, my love for you  
And keeping it that way is my intention  
As good as new and growing too  
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension  
It's as good as new, my love for you  
Just like it used to be and even better  
As good as new, thank God it's true  
Darling, we were always meant to stay together  
  
Yes the love I have for you feels as good as new  
Darling, we were always meant to stay together


Making somebody happy is a question of give and take  
You can learn how to show it so come on, give yourself a break  
Every smile and every little touch  
Don't you know that they mean so much  
Sweet sweet kisses so tender  
Always will return to sender  
  
Like a bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum  
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum  
So give it away, I think you'll learn  
You'll get love in return  
So bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love  
A boom-a-boomerang is love  
  
Love is always around and you can look for it anywhere  
When you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care  
Never use it as a selfish tool  
Never ever be such a fool  
Every feeling you're showing  
Is a boomerang you're throwing  
  
Yes a bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum  
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum  
So give it away, I think you'll learn  
You'll get love in return  
So bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love  
  
And if you're warm and tender  
I'll kiss you, return to sender  
Please surrender

Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum  
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love  
A boom-a-boomerang is love

Well, you hoot and you holler and you make me mad  
And I've always been under your heel  
Holy christ what a lousy deal  
Now I'm sick and tired of your tedious ways  
And I ain't gonna take it no more  
Oh no no - walkin' out that door  
  
Burning my bridges, cutting my tie  
Once again I wanna look into the eye  
Being myself  
Counting my pride  
No un-right neighbour's gonna take me for a ride  
Burning my bridges  
Moving at last  
Girl I'm leaving and I'm burying the past  
Gonna have peace now  
You can be free  
No one here will make a sucker out of me


Down in the street they're all singing and shouting  
Staying alive though the city is dead  
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter  
While you are crying alone on your bed  
  
Pity Cassandra that no one believed you  
But then again you were lost from the start  
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets  
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
So in the morning your ship will be sailing  
Now that your father and sister are gone  
There is no reason for you to linger  
You're grieving deeply but still moving on  
  
You know the future is casting a shadow  
No one else sees it but you know your fate  
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough  
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise  
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain  
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure  
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I'm sorry Cassandra  
I'm sorry Cassandra


Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong  
You're enchained by your own sorrow  
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow  
How I hate to see you like this  
There is no way you can deny it  
I can see that you're oh so sad, so quiet  
  
Chiquitita, tell me the truth  
I'm a shoulder you can cry on  
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on  
You were always sure of yourself  
Now I see you've broken a feather  
I hope we can patch it up together  
  
Chiquitita, you and I know  
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving  
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
You will have no time for grieving  
Chiquitita, you and I cry  
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
  
So the walls came tumbling down  
And your love's a blown out candle  
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle  
Chiquitita, tell me the truth  
There is no way you can deny it  
I see that you're oh so sad, so quiet  
  
Chiquitita, you and I know  
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving  
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
You will have no time for grieving  
Chiquitita, you and I cry  
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita


I was out with the morning sun  
Couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd take a walk  
I was thinking of you and me  
And I went to your house, 'cause I had to talk  
  
I could hardly believe my eyes  
When I saw this guy closing your front door  
Had the feeling of emptiness like I never had before  
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
As he disapeared in his car  
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do  
Everything I had ever dreamed  
  
Everything in my life's part of you  
And I just couldn't move my feet  
So I stood on the pavement as you came out  
You acted as you didn't know what it was all about  
  
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
Baby, how could you do it  
You just told me lies  
  
And you meet behind my back  
With other guys  
Baby, how could you tell me  
There was only me  
  
I was stupid to believe you  
I was blind but now I see  
Then you smiled and you took my hand  
"There is something", you said, "that you may not know  
  
There's a couple of men in my life  
And one of them is my brother Joe  
He's been gone for a long, long time  
But he's back and I think he's gonna stay  
  
You'll be seeing a lot of him, he's so nice in every way"  
Then I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
So I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
So I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world


I'm waitin' for you baby  
I'm sitting all alone  
I feel so cold without you  
It chills me to the bone  
I never thought you'd leave me  
But now I know it's true  
Oh Lord I'm blue  
I'm cryin' over you  
I'm waitin' for you baby  
I'm sittin' all alone  
I feel so cold without you  
It chills me to the bone  
I never thought you'd leave me  
But now I know it's true  
Oh Lord I'm blue  
I'm cryin' over you  
  
Cryin' over you  
I'm cryin' over you  
Cryin' over  
Little memories of things we used to do  
Oh Lord I'm blue  
I'm cryin' over you  
Oh Lord I'm blue  
I'm cryin' over you  
Oh Lord I'm blue  
I'm cryin' over you


Oh, my love it makes me sad.  
Why did things turn out so bad?  
Was it just a dream, everything we did, everything we had?  
  
Baby, give me one more  
Dance while the music still goes on  
Don't think about tomorrow  
Dance and forget our time is gone  
Tonight's a night we borrow.  
Let's make it a memory, a night of our own  
A thing to remember when we're all alone  
So dance, it's our way to say goodbye  
  
Yes, all we have to do is  
Dance while the music still goes on  
This is no time for crying  
Dance, don't you hear them play our song  
God knows that we've been trying  
But we didn't make it 'cause nothing's the same  
We just couldn't help it, nobody's to blame  
So dance while the music still goes on  
And let it be our last goodbye  
  
Yet it seems to make me sad.  
Why did things turn out so bad?  
Was is just a dream, everything we did, everything we had?  
  
Baby, give me one last  
Dance while the music still goes on  
Just like the night I met you  
Dance and believe me, when you're gone  
You know I won't forget you  
Our love was a snowbird, it's flying away  
You tell me it's over, what more can I say?  
So dance while the music still goes on  
It's gonna be our last goodbye  
  
Dance while the music still goes on  
Don't think about tomorrow  
Dance and forget our time is gone  
Tonight's a night we borrow.  
Let's make it a memory, a night of our own  
A thing to remember when we're all alone  
So dance while the music still goes on  
And let it be our last goodbye  
  
Dance while the music still goes on  
This is no time for crying  
Dance, don't you hear them play our song  
God knows that we've been trying  
Dance while the music still goes on  
Just like the night I met you  
Dance and believe me, when you're gone  
You know I won't forget you

You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life  
See that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the Dancing Queen  
  
Friday night and the lights are low  
Looking out for the place to go  
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing  
You come in to look for a king  
Anybody could be that guy  
Night is young and the music's high  
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance  
  
You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen  
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine  
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life  
See that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the Dancing Queen  
  
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on  
Leave them burning and then you're gone  
Looking out for another, anyone will do  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance  
  
You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen  
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine  
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life  
See that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the Dancing Queen


Changing, moving in a circle  
I can see your face in all of my dreams  
Smiling, laughing from the shadows  
When I hear your voice, I know what it means  
I know it doesn't matter just how hard I try  
You're all the reason for my life  
  
Disillusion, disillusion's all you left for me  
How can I forget you when my world is breaking down  
You're all I had, you're all I want  
Disillusion, disillusions, now that's all I have  
  
Wishing, hoping, chasing shadows  
Did I see your face somewhere in the crowd  
Thinking, wondering what you're doing  
I can't stop myself from crying out loud  
They say my wound will heal and only leave a scar  
But then, they never shared our love  
  
Disillusion, disillusion's all you left for me  
How can I forget you when my world is breaking down  
You're all I had, you're all I want  
Disillusion, disillusions, now that's all I have  
  
Disillusion, disillusions, now that's all I have


You're so hot, teasing me  
So you're blue but I can't take a chance on a chick like you  
That's something I couldn't do  
There's that look in your eyes  
I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild  
Ah, but girl you're only a child  
  
Well I can dance with you honey  
If you think it's funny  
Does your mother know that you're out?  
And I can chat with you baby  
Flirt a little maybe  
Does your mother know that you're out?  
  
Take it easy (take it easy)  
Better slow down girl  
That's no way to go  
Does your mother know?  
  
Take it easy (take it easy)  
Try to cool it girl  
Take it nice and slow  
Does your mother know?  
  
I can see what you want  
But you seem pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun  
So maybe I'm not the one  
Now you're so cute, I like your style  
And I know what you mean when you give me a flash of that smile (smile)  
But girl you're only a child  
  
Well I can dance with you honey  
If you think it's funny  
Does your mother know that you're out?  
And I can chat with you baby  
Flirt a little maybe  
Does your mother know that you're out?  
  
Take it easy (take it easy)  
Better slow down girl  
That's no way to go  
Does your mother know?  
  
Take it easy (take it easy)  
Try to cool it girl  
Take it nice and slow  
Does your mother know?  
  
Well I can dance with you honey  
If you think it's funny  
Does your mother know that you're out?  
And I can chat with you baby  
  
Flirt a little maybe  
Does your mother know that you're out?


Agnetha We're not the stars of a Hollywood movie  
So what's the use to pretend  
I'm not so charming and you're not so groovy  
You've got to face it my friend  
  
Agnetha, Frida Dreamworld, you've been living in a dreamworld  
Trust me, you just can't escape from reality  
Boy meets girl, doesn't mean they're in a dreamworld  
Here I am, here you are,  
  
We're gonna make it together  
And within, it's a fuss  
So we can only get better  
Agnetha When you reach up and you say to me  
  
How I love you, girl  
When I hold you, baby, can't you see  
That's the way we whirl  
You had your hopes and your high expectations  
  
Somehow it doesn't seem right  
I'm getting fed-up with your acquisitions  
I'm not your angel in white  
Agnetha, Frida Dreamworld, you've been living in a dreamworld  
  
Trust me, you just can't escape from reality  
Boy meets girl, doesn't mean they're in a dreamworld

We're gonna make it together  
  
And within, it's a fuss  
So we can only get better

I can hear how you work, practising hard  
Playing night and day, wo-oh  
And it sounds better now, yes you improve  
Everytime you play, wo-oh  
But it's bad  
You're so sad  
And you're only smiling  
When you play your violin  
  
Dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
To be so near you and not just hear you  
Dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby  
You'd be mine  
And we'd be together all the time  
Wish I was dumb dumb diddle, your darling fiddle  
  
But I think, you don't know that I exist  
I'm the quiet kind, wo-oh  
From the day when I first listened to you  
You've been on my mind, wo-oh  
You don't care  
It's not fair  
And you're only smiling  
When you play your violin  
  
Dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
To be so near you and not just hear you  
Dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby  
You'd be mine  
And we'd be together all the time  
  
Dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
To be so near you and not just hear you  
Dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby  
You'd be mine  
And we'd be together all the time  
Wish I was dumb dumb diddle, your darling find


They came flying from far away, now I'm under their spell  
I love hearing the stories that they tell  
They've seen places beyond my land and they've found new horizons  
They speak strangely but I understand  
  
And I dream I'm an eagle  
And I dream I can spread my wings  
Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky  
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze  
High, high, what a feeling to fly  
Over mountains and forests and seas  
And to go anywhere that I please  
  
As all good friends we talk all night, and we fly wing to wing  
I have questions and they know everything  
There's no limit to what I feel, we climb higher and higher  
Am I dreaming or is it all real?  
  
Is it true I'm an eagle?  
Is it true I can spread my wings?  
Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky (I'm an eagle)  
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze  
High, high, what a feeling to fly (What a feeling)  
Over mountains and forests and seas  
And to go anywhere that I please


Every good man needs a helping hand  
so I travel alone if I can  
Every man has a guiding star  
and he knows what he's gonna get  
when he's going too far  
  
Living on the dark side once again  
It's sad to lose a friend  
Looking at things with empty feelings  
Still we're going on  
  
For Every good man needs a helping hand  
I should have known too  
Some of us learn too late, I'm sorry  
Every good man needs a helping hand  
It's true  
  
Every good man needs a helping hand  
so I travel alone if I can  
Every man has a guiding star  
and he knows  
what he's gonna get  
when he's going too far  
  
Living on the dark side once again  
It's sad to lose a friend  
Looking at things with empty feelings  
Still we're going on  
  
For Every good man needs a helping hand  
I should have known too  
Some of us learn too late, I'm sorry  
Every good man needs a helping hand  
It's true


Can you hear the drums Fernando?  
I remember long ago another starry night like this  
In the firelight Fernando  
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar  
I could hear the distant drums  
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar  
  
They were closer now Fernando  
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally  
I was so afraid Fernando  
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die  
And I'm not ashamed to say  
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry  
  
There was something in the air that night  
The stars were bright, Fernando  
They were shining there for you and me  
For liberty, Fernando  
Though I never thought that we could lose  
There's no regret  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
  
Now we're old and grey Fernando  
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand  
Can you hear the drums Fernando?  
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?  
I can see it in your eyes  
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land  
  
(Repeat x2)  
There was something in the air that night  
The stars were bright, Fernando  
They were shining there for you and me  
For liberty, Fernando  
Though I never thought that we could lose  
There's no regret  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
  
Yes, if I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando...


Puedes escuchar Fernando?  
Me recuerda tiempo atras  
Estrellas y una noche alla  
En la lumbre azul Fernando  
Tarareabas tu cancion  
Con ese suave guitarrear  
Yo podia escuchar  
Esos tambores con un sordo redoblar  
  
Se acercaban mas fernando  
Y el momento que pasaba  
Parecia eternidad  
Y senti temor Fernando  
Por la vida y juventud  
Nadie pensaba en morir  
Y no siento hoy verguenza al  
Confesar que tuve  
Ganas de llorar  
  
Algo habia alrededor quiza  
De claridad Fernando  
Que brillaba por nosotros dos  
En proteccion Fernando  
No pensabamos jamas perder  
Ni echar atras  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
  
La vejez llego Fernando  
Y con ella una paz  
Que hoy logramos disfrutar  
Se durmio el tambor Fernando  
Paraciera que fue ayer  
Que lo vivimos tu y yo  
Y en tus ojos veo aun  
Aquel orgullo que refleja tu valor.  
  
Algo habia alrededor quiza  
De claridad Fernando  
Que brillaba por nosotros dos  
En proteccion Fernando  
No pensabamos jamas perder  
Ni echar atras  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
  
Algo habia alrededor quiza  
De claridad Fernando  
Que brillaba por nosotros dos  
En proteccion Fernando  
No pensabamos jamas perder  
Ni echar atras  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando

I'm down and I feel depressed  
Sitting here just waiting  
For next bus travelling  
Downtown  
It's a crying shame  
Isn't it  
The beautiful weather  
If I could have my way  
Well, I would not be working  
On a day like this I know what I'd like to be  
As free as a bumble bee  
Take a sip from  
Every flower  
Free as a bumble bee  
While away each lazy hour  
What a good life  
Lying laid back  
Like an old railroad bum by the track  
What a good life  
Living outdoors  
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw


Twinkle, Twinkle little star  
How I wonder what you are  
Like a diamond glitt'ring in the sky  
Seems to me you shine your light  
Down to me to say goodnight  
Twinkle, Twinkle my old friend  
Sleep is waiting round the bend  
While you travel through the milky way  
From afar  
Twinkle, Twinkle, Twinkle little star.  
  
Raindrops on a window pane  
Stillness of a summer rain  
Silently the haze drifts through the trees  
Slowly dawn is breaking through  
Yet a morning without you  
  
Curtins rustling in the breeze  
I'm still trapped within my dreams  
Daylight makes it's way into my mind  
Coming through  
Yet another morning without you.  
  
Finally when darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warm my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes backs to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Mmm, Mmm, Mmm- echoes of a voice I knew  
  
Half awake in half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room.  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Long awaited darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warms my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes back to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Half awake and half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room.


Half past twelve  
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone  
How I hate to spend the evening on my own  
Autumn winds  
Blowing outside my window as I look around the room  
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
  
Movie stars  
Find the end of the rainbow, with a fortune to win  
It's so different from the world I'm living in  
Tired of T. V.  
I open the window and I gaze into the night  
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight...  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight...  
  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day


There's a gentleness to everything you do  
And it's rubbing off on me I feel it too  
I've been waiting but my loneliness I get  
When you call me on the phone  
And I'm feeling so alone  
When you ask me to come over  
Baby you know I will  
I could never stay on my own  
  
Givin' it all I got to give  
I've never done that before  
I'm always givin' a little more  
When I'm with you  
  
Givin' it all I got to give  
I've never done that before  
I'm always givin' a little more  
When I'm with you  
I'm always givin' a little more  
When I'm with you  
  
Givin' it all I got to give  
I've never done that before  
I'm always givin' a little more  
When I'm with you  
Givin' it all I got to give  
I've never done that before  
I'm always givin' a little more


You say she's been mad at you  
Then you say you'll be patient, ooh  
Still I see that she makes you blue  
Come on, I'll give you consolation  
  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna bring you some light  
Gonna make you feel happy every day of your life  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna make it all right  
You're all I ever need, my darling  
  
Just to be where you want to be  
So much fun we could have then, hmm  
To be close for eternity  
What a miracle to happen  
  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna sing it for you  
Gonna give you sweet loving, gonna give myself too  
Gonna sing you my love song, when I think about you  
I know she doesn't make it easy  
'Cause you don't please her like you please me  
  
You're my life, you're my angel  
You're my first, you're my last  
Would she care if you lingered  
For another night  
Want to hold you tight  
We could make it right  
  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna bring you some light  
Gonna make you feel happy every day of your life  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna make it all right  
I know she doesn't make it easy  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna sing it for you  
Gonna give you sweet loving, gonna give myself too  
Gonna sing you my love song, when I think about you  
You're all I ever need, my darling  
And I would love to sing my love song  
For you


When the autumn leaves are falling to the ground  
When the air gets cold then I think of us  
Of you and I  
And it almost makes me cry  
So sad and kind of bitter sweet  
And the memories filled with tears  
And I feel my heart will break  
Guess it all was my mistake  
  
Autumn's chilly winds were blowing through the trees  
The rain fell softly on your face  
Oh I remember every little thing about that day  
I remember every place  
Grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds  
The rain fell softly on your face  
The memories of our time together cannot be replaced  
I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days


Agnetha, Frida Early this morning I drove in the rain  
Out to the airport to get on the plain  
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii  
Alice has been there, she said it was fun  
  
Swimming and surfing, enjoying the sun  
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii  
After all I had to go through, I'm making no plans  
But I, but I believe love gives me a second chance  
  
Guess I've been working a little to hard  
Need a vacation, I'll send you a card  
From Honolulu, a greeting from happy Hawaii  
It's so exciting, why should I pretend  
  
In a few hours the plane will descend  
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii  
I can imagine the beach and the sand  
Walking with someone and holding his hand  
  
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii  
After all I had to go through, I'm making no plans  
But I, but I believe love gives me a second chance  
I've got a feeling, the dream will come true  
  
Someone is waiting and I forget you  
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii


No more champagne  
And the fireworks are through  
Here we are, me and you  
Feeling lost and feeling blue  
It's the end of the party  
And the morning seems so grey  
So unlike yesterday  
Now's the time for us to say  
  
Happy New Year  
Happy New Year  
May we all have a vision now and then  
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend  
Happy New Year  
Happy New Year  
May we all have our hopes, our will to try  
If we don't we might as well lay down and die  
You and I  
  
Sometimes I see  
How the brave new world arrives  
And I see how it thrives  
In the ashes of our lives  
Oh yes, man is a fool  
And he thinks he'll be okay  
Dragging on, feet of clay  
Never knowing he's astray  
Keeps on going anyway  
  
Happy New Year  
Happy New Year  
May we all have a vision now and then  
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend  
Happy New Year  
Happy New Year  
May we all have our hopes, our will to try  
If we don't we might as well lay down and die  
You and I  
  
Seems to me now  
That the dreams we had before  
Are all dead, nothing more  
Than confetti on the floor  
It's the end of a decade  
In another ten years time  
Who can say what we'll find  
What lies waiting down the line  
In the end of eighty-nine  
  
Happy New Year  
Happy New Year  
May we all have a vision now and then  
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend  
Happy New Year  
Happy New Year  
May we all have our hopes, our will to try  
If we don't we might as well lay down and die  
You and I


Benny I was a fighter, always looking for trouble  
And my life was so empty, there was nothing to live for  
But then it happened one night  
As I got into a fight  
I could hear someone saying  
As though he was praying  
  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
You might need his help one day  
We depend one one another  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
On the road  
That we're going  
We all need  
Words of comfort and compassion  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
I was a woman, never thinking of others  
And my life was so lonely, didn't care for anybody  
But then I happened to meet  
A begging man in the street  
As I turned down his praying  
I heard someone saying  
  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
You might need his help one day  
We depend one one another  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
On the road  
That we're going  
We all need  
Words of comfort and compassion  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
You might need his help one day  
We depend one one another  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
You might need his help one day  
We depend one one another  
Love him, that's the only way


I have a very good friend  
The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend  
She has a personal style  
Some people love it others tend to go wild  
You hear her voice everywhere  
Taking the chair  
She's a leading lady  
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going  
  
Head over heels  
Breaking her way  
Pushing through unknown jungles every day  
She's a girl with a taste for the world  
(The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)  
Head over heels  
Setting the pace  
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace  
She's extreme if you know what I mean  
  
Her man is one I admire  
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired  
Each time when he speaks his mind  
She pats his head and says that's all very fine  
Exert that will of your own  
When you're alone  
Now we better hurry  
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going  
  
Head over heels  
Breaking her way  
Pushing through unknown jungles every day  
She's a girl with a taste for the world  
(The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)  
Head over heels  
Setting the pace  
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace  
She's extreme if you know what I mean  
  
You hear her voice everywhere  
Taking the chair  
She's a leading lady  
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going  
  
Head over heels  
Breaking her way  
Pushing through unknown jungles every day  
She's a girl with a taste for the world  
(The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)  
Head over heels  
Setting the pace  
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace  
She's extreme if you know what I mean  
(She's just one of those who always has to do whatever she please)  
And she goes  
Head over heels


Love, love is a dream  
We were like two young strands of driftwood  
Caught up in a stream  
We were destined for each other  
From our very first hello  
We came bustin' through that river dam  
And made that river flow  
We will sail upon the ocean  
Til the shoreline meets the sky  
Carried on the first trade wind  
That favours you and I  
We have both of us between us  
Known misfortune in our days  
Darling this time, we're on our way  
  
'Cause we're here  
And here we'll stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
We are here  
And here we'll stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
  
Life, oh life is a chance  
We were the only two who spun the wheel  
And never scored romance  
If we'd stayed to play for fortune  
We'd have broke the banks of gold  
We'd have taken old Las Vegas  
For every cent that she could hold  
Love like ours was made in heaven  
It was blessed by Lord above  
We will spend our lives together  
Forever hand in glove  
We have both of us between us  
Known misfortune in our days  
Darling this time, we're on our way  
  
'Cause we're here  
And here we'll stay  
We won't ever throw this love of ours away  
We are here  
And here we'll stay  
We won't ever throw this love of ours away  
  
'Cause we're here  
And here we'll stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
We are here  
Here we'll stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
  
'Cause we're here  
And here we'll stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
So we are here  
And here we'll stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away...


So at last you're free  
It's the way you wanted it to be  
And the price you paid  
To become a woman of today  
Is it worth the pain to see the children cry  
Does it hurt when they ask for Daddy  
  
Hey hey Helen  
Now you live on your own  
Hey hey Helen  
Can you make it alone  
(Yes you can)  
  
So you're free at last  
And beginning to forget the past  
Does it make you sad  
When you think about the life you ha-ha-had  
But you're right, you had to take a second chance  
So you fight to find your freedom  
  
Hey hey Helen  
Now you live on your own  
Hey hey Helen  
Can you make it alone  
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)  
What's the matter with you  
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)  
Don't you know what to do  
(Yes you do)  
(Yes you do yes you do)  
(Yes you do yes you do)  
  
Hey hey Helen  
Now you live on your own  
Hey hey Helen  
Can you make it alone  
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)  
What's the matter with you  
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)  
Don't you know what to do  
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)  
Now you live on your own  
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)


You feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues  
Sometimes life is a burden, weighed down in your shoes  
When it's bad, worse, worst  
(And when you're feeling so bad)  
And you think you're cursed  
(And you've got it sad)  
Well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose  
  
It's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
My friend Sam is a chauffeur, Annie goes to school  
Jerry works at the office, Sue lies by the pool  
But on all weekends  
(Together again)  
When I meet my friends  
(I'm gonna see them now)  
And we're lookin' round for the action we sure play it cool  
  
It's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
You paint your world and use all colors  
And then you find it all comes out too bright  
You know it's only a lie  
The songs you sing are too romantic  
And when you want the truth  
They only spit in your eye  
Oh yeah, they're only telling you lies  
Oh yeah, there's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
You feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues  
Sometimes life is a burden, weighed down in your shoes  
When it's bad, worse, worst  
(You know you're feeling so bad)  
And you think you're cursed  
(And you've got it sad)  
Well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose  
  
It's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul


Honey honey, how you thrills me, ah-hah, honey honey  
Honey honey, nearly kill me, ah-hah, honey honey  
I'd heard about you before  
I wanted to know some more  
And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine  
Oh, you make me dizzy  
  
Honey honey, let me feel it, ah-hah, honey honey  
Honey honey, don't conceal it, ah-hah, honey honey  
The way that you kiss goodnight (The way that you kiss me goodnight)  
The way that you hold me tight (The way that you're holding me tight)  
I feel like I want to sing when you do your thing  
  
I don't want to hurt you, baby, I don't want to see you cry  
So stay on the ground, girl, you better not get too high  
But I'm gonna stick to you, boy, you'll never get rid of me  
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be  
  
Honey honey, touch me, baby, ah-hah, honey honey  
Honey honey, hold me, baby, ah-hah, honey honey  
You look like a movie star (You look like a movie star)  
But I know just who you are (I know just who you are)  
And, honey, to say the least, you're a dog-gone beast  
  
So stay on the ground, girl, you better not get too high  
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be  
  
Honey honey, how you thrill me, ah-hah, honey honey  
Honey honey, nearly kill me, ah-hah, honey honey  
I heard about you before  
I wanted to know some more  
And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine


I am just a girl  
One among the others, nothing much to say  
Plain and simple girl  
Not a special type in any way  
Just one look and you will surely see  
That the true Miss Nobody is me  
It's an evil world  
That has only made me a girl  
  
I am just a girl  
Not the kind of woman men would like to meet  
Just another girl  
No one ever looks at in the street  
But today I can't believe it's true  
When you smiled and whispered, I love you  
Darling I could see  
I was meant to be your girl  
  
It's a funny feeling when you get to love someone  
And thinking that he'll never look your way  
But then he says he loves you and life has just begun  
It's so much more than any words can say  
  
I am just a girl  
Not the kind of woman men would like to meet  
Just another girl  
No one ever looks at in the street  
But today I can't believe it's true  
When you smiled and whispered, I love you  
Darling I could see  
I was meant to be your girl  
  
La, la, la, la la  
  
But today I can't believe it's true  
When you smiled and whispered, I love you  
Darling I could see  
I was meant to be your girl


i am the city, you let me be  
i am the city  
  
Coming through a cloud you're looking at me from above  
And I'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes  
And you find me beautiful and irresistible  
A kind of creature that forever seems to grow in size  
And you feel a strange attraction  
The air is vibrant and electrified  
Welcome to me here I am, my arms are open wide  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
And a million voices blend into a single voice  
And you can hear it in the glamor of the crowded streets  
People come and take their chances  
Sometimes you win sometimes you lose a lot  
Come make your own contribution to this melting pot  
  
I'm the street you walk  
The language you talk  
I am the city  
The skyline is me and the energy  
I am the city  
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars  
And the funny smells  
And the turmoil, the cars and the people  
The air that you're breathing is me  
Yes I am the city, you let me be  
  
People feed me with their lives I have a hungry soul  
And they all worship me and pay their homage day and night  
Every day I knew a lot of tired shopping feet  
But come the night they will be dancing in the neon light  
Dazzled by the crazy magic  
They're grabbing pieces of the fatted calf  
And in the wind if you listen hard you'll hear me laugh  
  
I'm the street you walk  
The language you talk  
I am the city  
The skyline is me and the energy  
I am the city  
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars  
And the funny smells  
And the turmoil, the cars and the people  
The parks and the squares that you see  
All the sounds that you hear  
And the air that you're breathing is me  
Yes I am the city, you let me be  
  
I am the city  
You let me be  
I am the city  
  
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars  
And the funny smells  
And the turmoil the cars and the people  
The air that you're breathing is me  
  
Coming through a cloud  
You're looking at me from above  
And I'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes  
  
I'm the street you walk  
The language you talk  
I am the city  
Yes I am the city, you let me be  
  
And you find me beautiful and irresistible  
A kind of creature that forever seems to grow in size  
  
The skyline is me and the energy  
I am the city  
You let me be  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
  
And a million voices blend into a single voice  
And you can hear it in the glamor of the crowded streets  
  
The skyline is me and the energy  
I am the city  
You let me be  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats


Love me or leave me  
Make your choice but believe me  
I love you  
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do  
  
I can't conceal it  
Don't you see?  
Can't you feel it?  
Don't you too?  
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do  
  
Oh, I've been dreaming through my lonely past  
Now I've just made it  
I found you at last  
So come on  
Now let's try it  
I love you  
Can't deny it  
'Cause it's true  
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do  
  
Oh, no hard feelings between you and me  
If we can't make it  
But just wait and see  
  
So come on now lets try it  
I love you, can't deny it  
'Cause it's true, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do  
  
So love me or leave me  
Make your choice but believe me  
I love you, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do  
  
I can't conceal it, don't you see?  
Can't you feel it?  
Don't you too? I do, I do, I do, I do, I do


I have a dream, a song to sing  
To help me cope with anything  
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale  
You can take the future even if you fail  
I believe in angels  
Something good in everything I see  
I believe in angels  
When I know the time is right for me  
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream  
  
I have a dream, a fantasy  
To help me through reality  
And my destination makes it worth the while  
Pushing through the darkness still another mile  
I believe in angels  
Something good in everything I see  
I believe in angels  
When I know the time is right for me  
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream  
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream  
  
I have a dream, a song to sing  
To help me cope with anything  
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale  
You can take the future even if you fail  
I believe in angels  
Something good in everything I see  
I believe in angels  
When I know the time is right for me  
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream  
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream


I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs  
No poet has ever painted  
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart  
So strange, yet we're so well acquainted  
I let the music speak with no restrains  
I let my feelings take over  
Carry my soul away, into the world  
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day  
  
Where my mind is like an open window  
Where the high and healing winds blow  
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me  
I let them take me  
  
Let it be a joke, let it be a smile  
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while  
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn  
Rustling down an old alley  
And in the dead of night, I find myself a blind man  
In some ancient valley  
I let the music speak, leading me gently  
Urging me like a lover  
Leading me all the way, into a place  
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day  
  
Where I'm one with every grand illusion  
No disturbance, no intrusion  
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me  
I let them use me  
  
Let it be a joke, let it be a smile  
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while  
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
Let it be the joy of each new sunrise  
Or the moment when a day dies  
I surrender without reservation  
No explanation, no questions why  
I take it to me and let it flow through me  
Yes, I let the music speak  
I let the music speak


I saw it in the mirror  
I saw it in my face  
That I'm no longer needed  
Anyone can take my place  
I saw it in the mirror  
When I looked into my eyes  
'Cause something sure is wrong  
When this boy cries  
  
This boy cries  
  
I saw it in the mirror  
My head is hanging low  
And it ain't too familiar  
With the feelings that I show  
I know you say you love me  
But I'm looking through your lies  
It doesn't really bother you  
If this boy cries  
  
This boy cries  
  
I never thought I could cry for you  
But honey, I will miss you  
'Til the day I die  
'Til the day I die  
  
I saw it in the mirror  
I saw it in my face  
That I'm no longer needed  
Anyone can take my place  
I saw it in the mirror  
When I looked into my eyes  
'Cause something sure is wrong  
When this boy cries  
  
This boy cries  
This boy cries


This park and these houses, old streets I have walked  
Everything dear, will it be here  
One day when I am returning?  
My friends will get married, have children and homes  
It sounds so nice, well-planned and wise  
Never expecting surprises  
  
I wonder, it's frightening  
Leaving now, is that the right thing?  
I wonder, it scares me  
But who the the hell am I if I don't leave it  
I'm not a coward  
Oh no, I'll be strong  
One chance in a lifetime  
Yes I will take it, it can't go wrong  
  
My friends and my family, this dull little town  
Buses I've missed, boys that I've kissed  
Everything old and familiar  
  
I wonder, it's frightening  
Leaving now, is that the right thing?  
I wonder, it scares me  
But who the the hell am I if I don't leave it  
I'm not a coward  
Oh no, I'll be strong  
One chance in a lifetime  
Yes I will take it...  
Yes I will take it, it can't go wrong

I got appointments, work I have to do  
Keepin' me so busy all the day through  
They're the things that keep me from thinkin' of you  
Oh baby, I miss you so, I know I'm never gonna make it  
Oh, I'm so restless, I don't care what I say  
And I lose my temper ten times a day  
Still it's even worse when the night's on its way  
It's bad, oh, so bad  
  
Somehow I'd be doin' alright if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)  
I'd have courage left to fight if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)  
How I fear the time when shadows start to fall  
Sittin' here alone and starin' at the wall  
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights  
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)  
Somehow I'd be doin' alright if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)  
  
No-one to turn to, you know how it is  
I was not prepared for something like this  
Now I see them clearly, the things that I miss  
Oh baby, I feel so bad, I know I'm never gonna make it  
I got my business to help me through the day  
People I must write to, bills I must pay  
But everything's so different when night's on its way  
It's bad, oh, so bad  
  
Somehow I'd be doing alright if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)  
I'd have courage left to fight if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)  
How I fear the time when shadows start to fall  
Sittin' here alone and starin' at the wall  
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights  
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)  
Guess my future would look bright if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)  
  
If it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)  
if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)

You're so free  
That's what everybody's tellin' me  
Yet I feel like I'm an outward bound  
Pushed around refuge  
  
Something's wrong  
Got a feeling that I don't belong  
As if I have come from out of space  
Out of place, like King Kong  
  
I'm a marionette, just a marionette  
Pull the string  
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet  
Just as long as I sing  
  
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette  
'Round and 'round  
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette  
Just a silly old clown  
  
Like a doll  
Like a puppet with no will at all  
And somebody taught me how to talk  
How to walk, how to fall  
  
Can't complain  
I got no one but myself to blame  
Something's happening, I can't control  
Lost my hold, it's insane  
  
I'm a marionette, just a marionette  
Pull the string  
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet  
Just as long as I sing  
  
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette  
'Round and 'round  
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette  
Just a silly old clown  
  
Look this way  
Just a little smile is what they say  
You'll look better on the photograph  
If you laugh, that's o.k.!!  
  
I'm a marionette, just a marionette  
Pull the string  
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet  
Just as long as I sing  
  
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette  
'Round and 'round  
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette  
Just a silly old clown  
  
You're so free  
That's what everybody's tellin' me  
Yet I feel like I'm an outward bound  
Pushed around refugee


I, I've been in love before  
I thought I would no more  
Manage to hit the ceiling  
Still, strange as it seems to me  
You brought it back to me  
That old feeling  
  
I, I don't know what you do  
You make me think that you  
Possibly could release me  
I think you'll be able to  
Make all my dreams come true  
And you ease me  
  
You thrill me, you delight me  
You please me, you excite me  
You're something I'd been pleading for  
I love you, I adore you  
I lay my life before you  
I'll have you want me more and more  
And finally it seems my lonely days are through  
I've been waiting for you  
  
I, I'm gonna make you mine  
You're gonna feel so fine  
You'll never want to leave me  
I feel you belong to me  
Someday you will agree  
Please, believe me  
  
You thrill me, you delight me  
You please me, you excite me  
You're something I'd been pleading for  
I love you, I adore you  
I lay my life before you  
I'll have you want me more and more  
And finally it seems my lonely days are through  
I've been waiting for you  
Oh, I've been waiting for you


Super Trooper beams are gonna blind me  
But I won't feel blue  
Like I always do  
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you  
  
I was sick and tired of everything  
When I called you last night from Glasgow  
All I do is eat and sleep and sing  
Wishing every show was the last show  
(Wishing every show was the last show)  
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming  
(Glad to hear you're coming)  
Suddenly I feel all right  
(And suddenly it's gonna be)  
And it's gonna be so different  
When I'm on the stage tonight  
  
Tonight the  
Super Trooper lights are gonna find me  
Shining like the sun  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
Smiling, having fun  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)Feeling like a number one  
Tonight the  
Super Trooper beams are gonna blind me  
But I won't feel blue  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
Like I always do  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
  
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you  
  
Facing twenty thousand of your friends  
How can anyone be so lonely  
Part of a success that never ends  
Still I'm thinking about you only  
(Still I'm thinking about you only)  
There are moments when I think I'm going crazy  
(Think I'm going crazy)  
But it's gonna be alright  
(You'll soon be changing everything)  
Everything will be so different  
When I'm on the stage tonight  
  
Tonight the  
Super Trooper lights are gonna find me  
Shining like the sun  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
Smiling, having fun  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
Feeling like a number one  
Tonight the  
Super Trooper beams are gonna blind me  
But I won't feel blue  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)Like I always do  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you  
  
So I'll be there when you arrive  
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive  
And when you take me in your arms  
And hold me tight  
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight  
  
Tonight the  
Super Trooper lights are gonna find me  
Shining like the sun  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
Smiling, having fun  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
Feeling like a number one  
Tonight the  
Super Trooper beams are gonna blind me  
But I won't feel blue  
(Su-p-per Troo-p-per)  
Like I always do  
(Sup-p-per troop-p-per)  
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you  
Sup-p-per Troop-p-per lights are gonna find me  
Shining like the sun  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
Smiling, having fun  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
Feeling like a number one


Just a notion that's all  
Just a feeling that you're watchin' me  
Every move I'm making  
Am I reading your mind  
Cause it's almost like you're touching me  
There is no mistaking  
Just a notion  
That you'll be walkin' up to me  
In a while  
And you smile and say hello  
Then we'll be dancing through the night  
Knowing everything from there on  
Must be right  
  
Just a notion  
But somehow I know I'm not wrong  
If it's our destiny there's nothing we can do  
But tonight is very special  
It's the night for me and you


Well I was looking at a movie on the TV last night  
Then I had a very funny notion, yeah  
I really had to write a song about it  
And then I'm gonna sing it with my rock 'n roll band  
And I bet the people gonna like it, yeah  
I know that everybody's gonna shout it  
  
And what a dreadful mighty killer  
A big black wide gorilla  
  
[Chorus:]  
We do the King Kong song, won't you sing along  
Listen to the music and it couldn't go wrong  
We do the Kong Kong song, gotta sing along  
Can't you hear the beating of the monkey tom-tom  
Listen to the rhythm of the King Kong song  
  
Now we can make the jungle out of any old place  
We can make gorillas out of people, yeah  
Well who can tell a monkey from a monkey?  
So people get together, gonna have a good time  
Everybody listen to the music, yeah  
'Cause what we're gonna sing is kinda funky  
  
So let your arms hang down  
And waddle all around  
Like a dreadful mighty killer  
A big black wide gorilla  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like a dreadful mighty killer  
A big black wide gorilla  
  
[Chorus: x2]


Lay your head on my chest so you hear every beat of my heart  
Now there's nothing at all that can keep us apart  
Touch my lips, close your eyes and see with your fingertips  
Things that you do, and you know I'm crazy 'bout you  
  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
I'm at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
Caught in a landslide of emotions  
I've had my share of love affairs and they were nothing compared to this  
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  
Kisses of fire  
Kisses of fire  
  
When you sleep by my side I feel safe and I know I belong  
Still it's making me scared that my love is so strong  
Losing you It's a nightmare, babe, and to me it's new  
Never before did you see me begging for more  
  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
I'm at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
Caught in a landslide of emotions  
I've had my share of love affairs but they were nothing compared to this  
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  
Kisses of fire  
Kisses of fire  
  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
I'm at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
Caught in a land-slide of emotions  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
(I'm at the point of no returning)  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  
(Caught in a land-slide of emotions)  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
I'm at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
Caught in a land-slide of emotions


No more carefree laughter  
Silence ever after  
Walking through an empty house, tears in my eyes  
Here is where the story ends, this is goodbye  
  
Knowing me, knowing you (ah-haa)  
There is nothing we can do  
Knowing me, knowing you (ah-haa)  
We just have to face it, this time we're through  
(This time we're through, this time we're through  
This time we're through, we're really through)  
Breaking up is never easy, i know but i have to go  
(I have to go this time  
I have to go, this time i know)  
Knowing me, knowing you  
It's the best i can do  
  
Mem'ries (mem'ries), good days (good days), bad days (bad days)  
They'll be (they'll be), with me (with me) always (always)  
In these old familiar rooms children would play  
Now there's only emptiness, nothing to say  
  
Knowing me, knowing you (ah-haa)  
There is nothing we can do  
Knowing me, knowing you (ah-haa)  
We just have to face it, this time we're through  
(This time we're through, this time we're through  
This time we're through, we're really through)  
Breaking up is never easy, i know but i have to go  
(I have to go this time  
I have to go, this time i know)  
Knowing me, knowing you  
It's the best i can do


I wasn't jealous before we met  
Now every woman I see is a potential threat  
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice  
You've heard me saying that  
Smoking was my only vice  
But now it isn't true  
Now everything is new  
And all I've learned has overturned  
I beg of you  
  
Don't go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me  
  
It was like shooting a sitting duck  
A little smalltalk, a smile  
And baby I was stuck  
I still don't know what  
You've done with me  
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily  
I feel a kind of fear  
When I don't have you near  
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride  
I beg you dear  
  
Don't go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me  
Don't go sharing your devotion  
Lay all your love on me  
  
I've had a few little love affairs  
They didn't last very long and  
They've been pretty scarce  
I used to think that was sensible  
It makes the truth  
Even more incomprehensible  
'Cause everything is new  
And everything is you  
And all I've learned has overturned  
What can I do  
  
Don't go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me  
Don't go sharing your devotion  
Lay all your love on me


Long awaited darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warm my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes back to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Half awake and half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room


Spring in the air  
The sun was shining  
Still the day was cool  
Saw her waiting for a bus  
As she was going home from school  
  
Looking so cold  
I took her home and  
That was just the start  
We would meet the summer through  
And she was always in my heart  
  
Love has it's ways  
Like seasons come and go  
And tomorrow there will be another day  
Love has it's ways  
And so before you know  
When you turn around it may have gone away  
  
Early that fall  
I knew I loved her  
More than anything  
Gave her everything I had  
She even got a wedding ring  
  
But in the end  
The mind was restless  
And she had to go  
And the love I'd thought would live  
Was buried in the winter snow  
  
Love has it's ways  
Like seasons come and go  
And tomorrow there will be another day  
Love has it's ways  
And so before you know  
When you turn around it may have gone away  
  
Love has it's ways  
Like seasons come and go  
And tomorrow there will be another day  
Love has it's ways  
And so before you know  
When you turn around it may have gone away


Do you remember the first time, and all of your sweet sweet talk  
Ain't heard it a lot since then love  
Now look at that guy, he's making me cry  
He leaves everybody and he only says goodbye  
But if I would have to choose I wouldn't let you go  
Just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow  
Darling I know  
  
We gotta have patience  
Love isn't just a sensation  
Some of the time it gets rough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Giving love is a reason for living  
But a few things can be tough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
  
From the first moment I saw you I've treated you like a queen  
I've given you lots of presents  
Now listen to that, just look at that cat  
You'd think he was an angel but he's talking through his hat  
But if I would have to choose I wouldn't let you go  
Just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow  
Darling I know  
  
We gotta have patience  
Love isn't just a sensation  
Some of the time it gets rough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Giving  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Love is a reason for living  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
But a few things can be tough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
  
Patience  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Love isn't just a sensation  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Some of the time it gets rough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Giving  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Love is a reason for living  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
But a few things can be tough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough


I've always hated my room, it's so gloomy and dreary  
Always the dark, for the windows just face the back yard  
So I can't understand how it's happened, how everything's changing  
This old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter  
When you walked into the room it all got so much brighter  
  
You must have a lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
And I can feel your love anywhere (shining)  
Maybe even when you're not there (shining)  
The lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
You're shining like a star in the night (shining)  
I won't let you out of my sight (shining)  
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight  
  
How I remember the first time we went to movie  
We had decided to meet on the corner downtown  
And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me  
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter  
When you came into my life it all got so much brighter  
  
You must have a lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
And I can feel your love anywhere (shining)  
Maybe even when you're not there (shining)  
The lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
You're shining like a star in the night (shining)  
I won't let you out of my sight (shining)  
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight  
  
And I feel so good  
And I feel so right  
And I know that you must have a lovelight  
  
You've got lovelight  
And I can feel your love anywhere  
Maybe even when you're not there  
You've got lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
You're shining like a star in the night (shining)  
I won't let you out of my sight (shining)  
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight  
  
Everything about you is right  
Let it glow and let it be bright  
I don't want to lose your lovelight  
Shining like a star in the night


Sit down and listen 'cause I've got good news for you  
It was in the papers today  
Some physician had made a discovery  
This' what she had to say:  
(oooh you know that)  
  
She said that every result she had backed her  
Claiming that love's a longevity factor  
  
So lovers live a little longer, baby  
You and me, we got a chance to live twice  
Lovers live a little longer, ain't that nice  
Lovers live a little longer, baby

Making love is a dynamite drug, baby  
So why don't we start right away  
(ahh, please don't wait)  
  
I don't care if they're watching 'cause listen  
We've got a reason for each time we're kissing

You and me, we got a chance to live twice  
Lovers live a little longer, ain't that nice  
Lovers live a little longer, baby

[Chorus]  
Mamma mia, here I go again  
My my, how can I resist you?  
Mamma mia, does it show again  
My my, just how much I've missed you?  
  
Yes, I've been brokenhearted  
Blue since the day we parted  
Why, why did I ever let you go?  
Mamma mia, now I really know  
My my, I could never let you go  
I've been angry and sad about things that you do  
I can't count all the times that I've told you "we're through"  
And when you go, when you slam the door  
I think you know that you won't be away too long  
You know that I'm not that strong  
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring  
One more look and I forget everything  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yes, I've been brokenhearted  
Blue since the day we parted  
Why, why did I ever let you go?  
Mamma mia, even if I say  
"Bye bye, leave me now or never"  
Mamma mia, it's a game we play  
"Bye bye" doesn't mean forever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yes, I've been brokenhearted  
Blue since the day we parted  
Why, why did I ever let you go?  
Mamma mia, now I really know  
My my, I could never let you go


Did you see that man in the limousine  
With the pretty doll, he is fifty and the girl's only seventeen  
But she doesn't care, and she never will  
If he's ninety-five she don't give a damn  
Just as long as he pays the bill  
  
Did you see that man with a fat cigar  
He just left his lunch with a belly full of lobster and caviar  
He can choose the wine from a vintage year  
He will drink champagne in his limousine  
Where the rest of the street can peer  
  
'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle  
Just like a spider in a cobweb  
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss you double-cross  
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle  
He's never bothered by his conscience  
Deals with the Devil, 'cause he wants to be  
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle  
In the middle (in the middle, in the middle)  
  
But you see that man made a big mistake  
Even though he's got all his servants and a mansion beside a lake  
And the money too, all that he can spend  
He can buy the most, nearly anything  
But he can't buy the lot, his friend  
  
'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle  
Just like a spider in a cobweb  
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss you double-cross  
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle  
He's never bothered by his conscience  
Deals with the Devil, 'cause he wants to be  
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle  
In the middle (in the middle, in the middle)


Well, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother  
Please take me back to that place  
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
  
I remember all the games we used to play  
I really do  
And I went to see them almost everyday  
I wanted to  
Though we quarreled at times and had a few fights  
We were the best of friends  
We found a place in the sun  
A heaven of fun  
  
Well, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother  
Wildest kids you could see  
We could play together, climbing the apple tree  
Yes, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother  
Please take me back to that place  
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
  
They would take me out for football games and such  
They liked to play  
And I guess I didn't like it very much  
But anyway  
I was happy and proud to be with the boys  
Being a little girl  
I found a place in the sun  
A heaven of fun  
  
Well, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother  
Wildest kids you could see  
We could play together, climbing the apple tree  
Well, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother  
Please take me back to that place  
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
  
Well, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother  
Please take me back to that place  
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
  
Got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
Got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
Got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days


Sometimes when I'm mad  
There's a part of me that seems to be a little sad  
Sometimes when I scream  
There's a voice in me that says, "You shouldn't be so mean"  
Oh no, oh no  
Part of me is acting while the other stands beside  
Yes, I am to myself what Jekyll must have been to Hyde  
  
We're like sun and rainy weather  
Sometimes we're a hit together  
Me and I  
Gloomy moods and inspiration  
We're a funny combination  
Me and I  
I don't think I'm different or in any way unique  
Think about yourself for a minute  
And you'll find the answer in it  
Everyone's a freak  
  
Sometimes I have toyed  
With ideas that I got from good old Dr Freud  
Nothing new of course  
It may seem to you I try to break through open doors  
Oh no, oh no  
I just want to say a lot of that applies to me  
'Cause it's an explanation to my split identity  
  
We're like sun and rainy weather  
Sometimes we're a hit together  
Me and I  
Gloomy moods and inspiration  
We're a funny combination  
Me and I  
I don't think I'm different or in any way unique  
Think about yourself for a minute  
And you'll find the answer in it  
Everyone's a freak  
  
Me and I  
  
We're like sun and rainy weather  
Sometimes we're a hit together  
Me and I  
Gloomy moods and inspiration  
We're a funny combination  
Me and I  
I don't think I'm different or in any way unique  
Think about yourself for a minute  
And you'll find the answer in it  
Everyone's a freak  
  
We're like sun and rainy weather  
Sometimes we're a hit together  
Me and I  
Gloomy moods and inspiration  
We're a funny combination  
Me and I


I have tried in vain never had success  
So it seems my life is nothing but a mess  
I have lost my only friend  
Now it seems I have to start again  
  
Merry-go-round  
Where am I bound  
With my love and feelings  
Merry-go-round  
  
Who wants to kiss me  
And hug me and miss me  
Yes, who wants to do it  
I wish that I knew it  
  
Merry-go-round  
Wish I had found  
Somebody to care for  
Where am I bound  
  
Life is so lonely  
If life is just only  
To love with my loving  
Goes round and round  
  
Looking for someone  
Who would want to stay  
I might find her  
With a bit of luck one day  
  
But who knows  
So until then  
I can only try and try again  
  
Merry-go-round  
Where am I bound  
With my love and feelings  
Merry-go-round  
  
Who wants to kiss me  
And hug me and miss me  
Yes, who wants to do it  
I wish that I knew it  
  
Merry-go-round  
Wish I had found  
Somebody to care for  
Where am I bound  
  
Life is so lonely  
If life is just only  
To love with my loving  
Goes round and round  
  
Merry-go-round  
Where am I bound  
With my love and feelings  
Merry-go-round  
  
Who wants to kiss me  
And hug me and miss me  
Yes, who wants to do it  
I wish that I knew it  
  
Merry-go-round  
Wish I had found  
Somebody to care for  
Where am I bound  
  
Life is so lonely  
If life is just only  
To love with my loving  
Goes round and round


Well, you wake up in the morning  
Hear the ding-dong ring  
You go marching to the table  
See the same old thing  
See the fork on the table  
Nothing in your pan  
If you sing a thing about it  
You're in trouble with the man  
  
Let the midnight special shine a light on me  
Let the midnight special shine it's ever loving light on me  
  
If you ever go to houston  
Well, you better act right  
And you better not gamble  
And you better not fight  
For the sheriff will arrest you  
Then he'll take you down  
And before you understand it  
You are prison bound  
  
Let the midnight special  
Shine a light on me  
Let the midnight special  
Shine it's ever loving light on me  
On me, on me


I work all night, I work all day, to pay the bills I have to pay  
Ain't it sad  
And still there never seems to be a single penny left for me  
That's too bad  
In my dreams I have a plan  
If I got me a wealthy man  
I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball...  
  
Money, money, money  
Must be funny  
In the rich man's world  
Money, money, money  
Always sunny  
In the rich man's world  
Aha-ahaaa  
All the things I could do  
If I had a little money  
It's a rich man's world  
  
A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind  
Ain't it sad  
And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldn't fancy me  
That's too bad  
So I must leave, I'll have to go  
To Las Vegas or Monaco  
And win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same...  
  
Money, money, money  
Must be funny  
In the rich man's world  
Money, money, money  
Always sunny  
In the rich man's world  
Aha-ahaaa  
All the things I could do  
If I had a little money  
It's a rich man's world  
  
Money, money, money  
Must be funny  
In the rich man's world  
Money, money, money  
Always sunny  
In the rich man's world  
Aha-ahaaa  
All the things I could do  
If I had a little money  
It's a rich man's world  
  
It's a rich man's world


They say a restless body can hide a peaceful soul.  
A voyager, ad a settler, they both have a distant goal.  
If I explore the heavens, or if I search inside.  
Well, it really doesn't matter as long as I can tell myself  
I've always tried.  
  
Like a roller in the ocean, life is motion  
Move on  
Like a wind that's always blowing, life is flowing  
Move on  
Like the sunrise in the morning, life is dawning  
Move on  
How I treasure every minute  
Being part of it, being in it  
With the urge to move on  
  
I've travelled every country, I've travelled in my mind  
It seems we're on a journey, a trip through space and time  
And somewhere lies the answer  
To all the questions why  
What really makes the difference  
Between all dead and living things, the will to stay alive  
  
Like a roller in the ocean (la la la la la la-la)  
Life is motion (la la la la la la-la)  
Move on (la la la la-la)  
Like a wind that's always blowing (la la la la la la-la)  
Life is flowing (la la la la la la-la)  
Move on (la la la la-la)  
Like the sunrise in the morning (la la la la la la-la)  
Life is dawning (la la la la la la-la)  
Move on (la la la la-la)  
How I treasure every minute (la la la la)  
Being part of it (la la la la)  
Being in it (la la la la)  
With the urge to move on  
  
The morning breeze that ripples the surface of the sea  
The crying of the seagulls that hover over me  
I see it and I hear it  
But how can I explain  
The wonder of the moment  
To be alive, to feel the sun that follows every rain  
  
Like a roller in the ocean (la la la la la la-la)  
Life is motion (la la la la la la-la)  
Move on (la la la la-la)  
Like a wind that's always blowing (la la la la la la-la)  
Life is flowing (la la la la la la-la)  
Move on (la la la la-la)  
Like the sunrise in the morning (la la la la la la-la)  
Life is dawning (la la la la la la-la)  
Move on (la la la la-la)  
How I treasure every minute (la la la la)  
Being part of it (la la la la-ah)  
Being in it  
With the urge to move on  
  
La la la la la la-la, la la la la la la-la, la la la la-la  
Like a wind that's always blowing  
La la la la la la-la  
La la la la la la-la (life is flowing)  
La la la la-la (move on)  
Like the sunrise in the morning  
La la la la la la-la  
La la la la la la-la (life is dawning)  
La la la la-la (move on)  
How I treasure every minute (la la la la)  
Being part of it (la la la la-ah)  
Being in it  
With the urge to move on  
La la la la la la-la, la la la la la la-la, la la la la-la  
Like a wind that's always blowing...  


I've seen it on your face  
Tells me more than any worn out old phrase  
So now we'll go separate ways  
Never again we two  
Never again, nothing I can do  
  
Like an image passing by, my love, my life  
In the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life  
I can see it all so clearly  
Answer me sincerely  
Was it a dream, a lie  
Like reflections of your mind, my love, my life  
Are the words you try to find, my love, my life  
But I know I don't posses you  
So go away, God bless you  
You are still my love and my life  
Still my one and only  
  
I've watched you look away  
Tell me is it really so hard to say  
Oh, this has been my longest day  
Sitting here close to you  
Knowing that maybe tonight we're trough  
  
Like an image passing by, my love, my life  
In the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life  
I can see it all so clearly  
Answer me sincerely  
Was it a dream, a lie  
Like reflections of your mind, my love, my life  
Are the words you try to find, my love, my life  
But I know I don't posses you  
So go away, God bless you  
You are still my love and my life  
  
Yes, I know I don't posses you  
So go away, God bless you  
You are still my love and my life  
Still my one and only


Tried to sneak out without saying  
With my loudest record playing  
Ooh, my mama said, "Look at this, you haven't done your bed"  
My mama said, "That's a thing that you should do instead"  
  
Then I did what she had told me  
Dying for my friend to hold me  
Ooh, my mama said, "Try and get one thing into your head"  
My mama said, "Pa and me, we give you room and bed"  
How I want to live my life  
Want to live my life  
La-la-la, la-la-la, life  
  
In the morning she said "Listen"  
Ooh, I felt like in a prison  
Yeah, my mama said, "I know you've been out again with Fred"  
(My mama said)  
My mama said, "Don't you lie, your cheeks are blushing red"  
(My mama said)  
Oh I want to live my life  
Want to live my life  
La-la-la, la-la-la, life  
  
I said I can live without it  
How I wish you wouldn't doubt it  
Ooh, my mama said, "If you want to hurt me go ahead"  
(My mama said)  
My mama said, "I suppose you'd rather see me dead"  
(My mama said)  
Oh I want to live my life  
Want to live my life  
La-la-la, la-la-la, life [Repeat: x4]


Every day in the morning on her way to the office  
You can see as she catches a train  
Just a face among a million faces  
Just another woman with no name  
Not the girl you'd remember but she's still something special  
If you knew her I am sure you'd agree  
'Cause I know she's got a little secret  
Friday evening she turns out to be  
  
Nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor  
This is the moment she's waited for  
Just like Cinderella, just like Cinderella  
Nina, pretty ballerina, who would ever think she could be this way  
This is the part that she likes to play  
But she knows the fun would go away  
If she would play it every day  
  
So she's back every morning to her work at the office  
And another week to live in a dream  
And another row of early mornings  
In an almost never-ending stream  
Doesn't talk very often, kind of shy and uncertain  
Everybody seems to think she's a bore  
But they wouldn't know her little secret  
What her Friday night would have in store  
  
Nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor  
This is the moment she's waited for  
Just like Cinderella, just like Cinderella  
Nina, pretty ballerina, who would ever think she could be this way  
This is the part that she likes to play  
She would like to play it every day  
  
Nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor  
This is the moment she's waited for  
Just like Cinderella, just like Cinderella  
Nina, pretty ballerina, who would ever think she could be this way  
This is the part that she likes to play


I was at a party  
And this feller said to me  
Something bad is happening  
I'm sure you do agree  
People care for nothing  
No respect for human rights  
Evil times are coming  
We are in for darker nights?  
I said who are you  
To talk about impending doom?  
He got kinda wary  
As he looked around the room  
He said, I'm a minister  
A big shot in the state?  
I said I just can't  
Believe it, boy  
I think it's great  
Brother can you tell me  
What is right and what is wrong?  
He said, keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone?  
  
On and on and on  
Keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone  
  
Over in the corner  
I could see this other guy  
He was kinda flirty  
He was giving me the eye  
So I took advantage  
Of the fact that I'm a star  
Shook my hair and took  
A casual stroll up to the bar  
And as sure as hell  
This guy was coming up to me  
He said, who am I and  
Who are you and who are we  
What's our situation do  
We have some time for us?  
I said, I was not exactly  
Waiting for the bus  
He said, if you're going  
Somewhere can I come along?  
I said, keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone?  
  
On and on and on  
Keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone


No smiles, not a single word at the breakfast table  
Though I would have liked to begin  
So much that I want to say, but I feel unable  
You leave and you slam the door  
Like you've done many times before  
And I cry and I feel so helpless  
  
One man, one woman  
Two friends and two true lovers  
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times  
One man, one woman  
One life to live together  
One chance to take that never comes back again  
You and me 'till the end  
  
Outside I can see the sun trough the open window  
Inside everything feel so cold  
What's wrong, what is happening, where did all our love go  
Somethimes when I just can't cope  
I cling to a desperate hope  
And I cry and I feel like dying  
  
One man, one woman  
Two friends and two true lovers  
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times  
One man, one woman  
One life to live together  
One chance to take that never comes back again  
You and me 'till the end  
  
Daydreams of a better life, but I have to wake up  
The sound of a key in the door  
You smile and I realize that we need a shake up  
Our love is a precious thing  
Worth the pain and the suffering  
And it's never too late for changin'  
  
One man, one woman  
Two friends and two true lovers  
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times  
One man, one woman  
One life to live together  
One chance to take that never comes back again  
You and me 'till the end  
  
You and me till' the end


They passed me by, all of those great romances  
You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances  
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy  
And so I dealt you the blow  
One of us had to go  
Now it's different, I want you to know  
  
One of us is crying  
One of us is lying  
In her lonely bed  
Staring at the ceiling  
Wishing she was somewhere else instead  
One of us is lonely  
One of us is only  
Waiting for a call  
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small  
Wishing she had never left at all  
  
I saw myself as a concealed attraction  
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action  
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving  
That's how I started the show  
One of us had to go  
Now I've changed and I want you to know  
  
One of us is crying  
One of us is lying  
In her lonely bed  
Staring at the ceiling  
Wishing she was somewhere else instead  
One of us is lonely  
One of us is only  
Waiting for a call  
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small  
Wishing she had never left at all  
Never left at all  
  
Staring at the ceiling  
Wishing she was somewhere else instead  
One of us is lonely  
One of us is only  
Waiting for a call  


The summer air was soft and warm  
The feeling right, the Paris night  
Did it's best to please us  
And strolling down the Elysee  
We had a drink in each cafe  
And you  
You talked of politics, philosophy and I  
Smiled like Mona Lisa  
We had our chance  
It was a fine and true romance  
  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain  
Our last summer  
Memories that remain  
  
We made our way along the river  
And we sat down in the grass  
By the Eiffel tower  
I was so happy we had met  
It was the age of no regret  
Oh yes  
Those crazy years, that was the time  
Of the flower-power  
But underneath we had a fear of flying  
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying  
We took the chance  
Like we were dancing our last dance  
  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame  
Our last summer  
Walking hand in hand  
  
Paris restaurants  
Our last summer  
Morning croissants  
Living for the day, worries far away  
Our last summer  
We could laugh and play  
  
And now you're working in a bank  
The family man, the football fan  
And your name is Harry  
How dull it seems  
Are you the hero of my dreams  
  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain  
Our last summer  
Memories that remain  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame  
Our last summer  
Walking hand in hand  
Paris restaurants  
Our last summer  
Morning croissants  
Living for the day, worries far away...


People need hope, people need lovin'  
People need trust from a fellow man  
People nee love to make a good livin'  
People need faith in a helping hand  
  
Man has alway wanted a woman by his side  
To keep him company  
Women always knew that it takes a man to get  
Matrimony and harmony  
Everybody knows that a man who's feeling down  
Wants some female company  
Gotta have love to carry on living  
Gotta have love 'til eternity

Flowers in a desert need a drop of rain  
Like a woman needs a man  
If a man's in love and his woman wants the moon  
Then he'll take it down if he can  
Somebody who loves you and somebody who cares  
Isn't that what you call a friend  
Gotta have love to carry on living  
Isn't it easy to understand  
  
People need hope, people need lovin'  
People need trust from a fellow man  
People nee love to make a good livin'  
People need faith in a helping hand

Put on your white sombrero  
Saddle your horse my dear  
And ride off into the sunset  
You'd better go  
For there is no  
Place for you here  
Like and old fashioned hero  
You stand before me  
You think our life is a movie  
My world is real  
I live and feel  
And I can do without you  
Put on your white sombrero  
Your red bandana too  
Think of this day as a showdown  
Goodbye my friend  
This is the end  
For me and you  
Now be a bold vacquero  
Don't show your feelings  
I'll cry while you're disappearing  
Into the night  
All dressed in white  
Unchained and free without me  
Put on your white sombrero  
Like all the cowboys do  
Go find a sweet senorita  
Somebody meek  
Who'll never speak  
Harshly to you  
You're such a cavaliero  
Proud, never bending  
I want someone who will take me  
Just as I am  
I need a man  
Who is in rhyme  
With his time  
You'll never take me  
Just as I am  
I need a man  
Who is in rhyme  
With his time  


You can dance  
You can jive  
Having the time of your life  
See that girl  
Watch that scene  
Dig in the dancing queen  
  
Friday night and the lights are low  
Looking out for a place to go  
Where they play the right music  
Getting in the swing  
You come to look for a king  
Anybody could be that guy  
Night is young and the music's high  
With a bit of rock music  
Everything is fine  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance  
  
You are the dancing queen  
Young and sweet  
Only seventeen  
Dancing queen  
Feel the beat from the tambourine  
You can dance  
You can jive  
Having the time of your life  
See that girl  
Watch that scene  
Dig in the dancing queen  
  
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on  
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone  
Looking out for another  
Anyone will do  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance  
  
You are the dancing queen  
Young and sweet  
Only seventeen  
Dancing queen  
Feel the beat from the tambourine  
You can dance  
You can jive  
Having the time of your life  
See that girl  
Watch that scene  
Dig in the dancing queen, digging the dancing queen

I was sitting by the phone  
I was waiting all alone  
Baby by myself I sit and wait and wonder about you  
It's a dark and dreary night  
Seems like nothing's going right  
Won't you tell me honey how can I go on here without you?  
  
Yes I'm down and feeling blue  
And I don't know what to do, oh-oh  
  
Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?  
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all  
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall  
And I sit all alone impatiently  
Won't you please understand the need in me  
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?  
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?  
  
You were here and now you're gone  
Hey did I do something wrong?  
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken  
Was it me or was it you?  
Tell me, are we really through?  
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking  
  
Please forgive and then forget  
Or maybe darling better yet, oh-oh  
  
Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?

Oh-oh, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?  
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?

Sitting in the darkest corner  
In the tender light I saw her face  
She was looking so sad and lonely  
Someone help me, someone save me  
I could see the look she gave me, oh  
Oh yeah, and there was one thing only  
That I knew I could do  
  
Let's go girl  
It's a beautiful place this world  
Come on baby let's dance  
To the rock'n'roll band  
Let's go now  
Let me show you that I know how  
Come on baby let's dance  
To the rock'n roll band  
Come on baby let's dance  
To the rock'n roll band  
You've been sitting there for hours  
Try to hide behind the flowers now  
Baby, we could have fun together  
Come on, cheer up, let's get started  
No use being broken-hearted now  
Oh yeah, you're gonna feel much better  
Yes I know that you will  
  
Let's go girl  
It's a beautiful place this world  
Come on baby let's dance  
To the rock'n roll band  
Let's go now

The poster on the wall of a dear friend  
I wish there was a way that I could show you how your songs set me free  
The hero of them all  
You're a legend  
I guess I'll never get a chance to know you  
Still you're close as can be  
  
Make the bandstand to a dreamland, Rubber Ball Man  
Clapping your hands, let your feet dance, Rubber Ball Man  
When you're jumping up and down, nobody's standing still  
Some of us dreaming, some of us screaming  
Look at your fans, how we love you, Rubber Ball Man!


Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find  
I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind  
Whatever happened to our love?  
I wish I understood  
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good  
  
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me  
S. O. S.  
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me  
S. O. S.  
When you're gone  
How can I even try to go on?  
When you're gone  
Though I try how can I carry on?  
  
You seem so far away though you are standing near  
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear  
I really tried to make it out  
I wish I understood  
What happened to our love, it used to be so good  
  
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me  
S. O. S.  
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me  
S. O. S.  
When you're gone  
How can I even try to go on?  
When you're gone  
Though I try how can I carry on?  
  
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me  
S. O. S.  
And the love you gave me, nothing else can save me  
S. O. S.  
When you're gone  
How can I even try to go on?  
When you're gone  
Though I try how can I carry on?  
When you're gone  
How can I even try to go on?  
When you're gone  
Though I try how can I carry on?


Frida  
He stands  
Towering over me beside my bed  
Losing his head  
  
Tells me  
I must take him seriously  
Droning on the usual way  
He's such a clever guy  
  
And I wonder  
Should I laugh or cry  
He's dressed  
In the striped pyjamas that I bought  
  
Trousers too short  
Gives me  
On his small philosophy  
Carries on the way he does  
  
And me I get so tired  
And I wonder  
Should I laugh or cry  
Agnetha, Frida  
  
High and mighty, his banner flies  
A fool's pride in his eyes  
Standing there on his toes  
To grow in size  
  
All I see is a big balloon  
Halfway up to the moon  
He's wrapped up in the warm  
And save cocoon  
  
Of an eternal lie  
So should I laugh or cry  
Frida  
Strange how  
  
Dangerously indifferent I have grown  
Cold as a stone  
No more  
Pain as there was pain before  
  
Far away he rambles on  
I feel my throat go dry  
And I wonder  
Should I laugh or cry  
  
Agnetha,  
Frida High and mighty, his banner flies  
A fool's pride in his eyes  
Standing there on his toes  
  
To grow in size  
All I see is a big balloon  
Halfway up to the moon  
He's wrapped up in the warm  
  
And save cocoon  
Of an eternal lie  
So should I laugh or cry


See me sitting in the palm tree  
Looking down at people passing by  
Sitting here no-one can harm me  
They just stare at me and wonder why  
No need to bother, I'm gonna stay up here  
Whatever happens, I won't let no-one near  
Until you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please  
You really love me, Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now  
And in the evening, when the sun goes down  
I'll be the bluest of men in this town  
'Cause I love you, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
  
See me sitting in the palm tree  
Waiting for those little words from you  
People laugh and point their fingers  
Like I was a monkey at the zoo  
But I will stay here, among my coconuts  
So you will know dear, you're everything I've got  
Now won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
  
Winds blow, stars glow, I see a light in a window  
Dark trees, soft breeze, carry my message to her please  
  
See me sitting in the palm tree  
Feeling angry at the silly crowd  
No-one else but you can calm me  
You should know by now I'm far too proud  
I need to show you, I've got my feelings too  
You shouldn't treat me like you always do  
So won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please  
You really love me, Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now  
And in the evening, when the sun goes down  
I'll be the bluest of men in this town  
'Cause I love you, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
  
Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine  
Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine  
Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine


Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning  
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile  
I watch her go with a surge of that well known sadness  
And I have to sit down for a while  
The feeling that I'm losing her forever  
And without really entering her world  
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter  
That funny little girl  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
I try to capture every minute  
The feeling in it  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
Do I really see what's in her mind  
Each time I think I'm close to knowing  
She keeps on growing  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
  
Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table  
Barely awake I let precious time go by  
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling  
And a sense of guilt I can't deny  
What happened to the wonderful adventures  
The places I had planned for us to go  
Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't  
And why, I just don't know  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
I try to capture every minute  
The feeling in it  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
Do I really see what's in her mind  
Each time I think I'm close to knowing  
She keeps on growing  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
  
Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture  
And save it from the funny tricks of time  
(Slipping through my fingers)  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning  
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile


You think you're gonna make me sulk, you and your fancy car, ah-ha-ha  
But I can tell you honey your tricks ain't gonna get you far, ah-ha-ha  
They say that money's got a magic touch  
But not to me, it doesn't mean that much  
You won't have me tonight  
All right, all right, all right, all right  
  
So long, see you honey  
You can't buy me with your money  
Chasing, dazing, driving me crazy  
But I'll never be your girl  
So long, see you honey  
You can't buy me with your money  
You know it's not worth trying  
So long, so long, so long  
  
You didn't have to send me flowers like you did today, ah-ha-ha  
I wouldn't keep a thing from you, I gave them all away, ah-ha-ha  
The girls might fall for everything you've got  
But I'm not one of them, you know I'm not  
You won't have me tonight  
All right, all right, all right, all right  
  
So long, see you honey  
You can't buy me with your money  
Chasing, dazing, driving me crazy  
But I'll never be your girl  
So long, see you honey  
You can't buy me with your money  
You know it's not worth trying  
So long, so long, so long  
  
So long, see you honey  
You can't buy me with your money  
You know it's not worth trying  
So long, so long, so long  
So long, so long, so long  
So long, so long, so long


Do I hear what I think I'm hearing  
Do I see the signs I think I see  
Or is this just a fantasy  
Is it true that the beast is waking  
Stirring in his restless sleep tonight  
In the pale moonlight  
  
In the grip of this cold December  
You and I have reason to remember  
  
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
The songs that you and I don't sing  
They blow their horns and march along  
They drum their drums and look so strong  
You'd think that nothing in the world was wrong  
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
The songs that you and I won't sing  
Let's not look the other way  
Taking a chance  
Cause if the bugler starts to play  
We too must dance  
  
What's that sound, what's that dreadful rumble  
Won't somebody tell me what I hear  
In the distance, but drawing near  
Is it only a storm approaching  
All that thunder and the blinding light  
In the winter night  
  
In the grip of this cold December  
You and I have reason to remember  
  
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
The songs that you and I don't sing  
They blow their horns and march along  
They drum their drums and look so strong  
You'd think that nothing in the world was wrong  
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
The songs that you and I won't sing  
Let's not look the other way  
Taking a chance  
Cause if the bugler starts to play  
We too must dance  
  
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
The songs that you and I won't sing  
Let's not look the other way  
Taking a chance  
Cause if the bugler starts to play  
We too must dance


And when I see the sign that points one way  
The lot we used to pass by every day  
  
Just walk away Renee  
You won't see me follow you back home  
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same  
You're not to blame  
  
From deep inside the tears I forced to cry  
From deep inside the pain I chose to hide  
  
Just walk away Renee  
You won't see me follow you back home  
Now as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes  
For me it cries  
  
Just walk away Renee  
You won't see me follow you back home  
Now as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes  
For me it cries  
  
Your name and mine inside a heart upon a wall  
Still find a way to haunt me  
Though they're so small  
  
Just walk away Renee  
You won't see me follow you back home  
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same  
You're not to blame


Summer night city  
Summer night city  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moonlight love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
In the sun I feel like sleeping  
I can't take it for too long  
My impatience slowly creeping  
Up my spine and going strong  
I know what's waiting there for me  
Tonight I'm loose and fancy free  
Ah-ah  
  
When the night comes with the action  
I just know it's time to go  
Can't resist the strange attraction  
From that giant dynamo  
Lots to take and lots to give  
Time to breathe and time to live  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moonlight love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
It's elusive call it glitter  
Somehow something turns me on  
Some folks only see the litter  
We don't miss them when they're gone  
I love the feeling in the air  
My kind of people everywhere  
Ah-ah  
  
When the night comes with the action  
I just know it's time to go  
Can't resist the strange attraction  
From this giant dynamo  
And tomorrow when it's dawning  
And the first birds starts to sing  
In the pale light of the morning  
Nothing's worth remembering  
  
It's a dream it's out of reach  
Scattered driftwood on the beach  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moon light love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moon light love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moon light love making in the park  
Summer night city


Suzy was nine and I was ten  
Right at the time when boys like to think they're men  
She used to follow us at school  
We really thought that she was a little fool  
And one day we said to her  
We don't want to hurt you girl  
But you'd better  
  
Look for a friend of your own, Suzy-hang-around  
Better come back when you're grown, Suzy-hang-around  
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure  
So get off our playground and stay away  
That's all that we've got to say  
Suzy-hang-around  
  
Suzy went home to Mama's arms  
Mama said "Look, she's never done you no harm  
So get off her back and let her be  
Why can't you play together in harmony?"  
We really didn't know what to say  
But as soon as she went away  
We laughed and said  
  
Look for a friend of your own, Suzy-hang-around  
Better come back when you're grown, Suzy-hang-around  
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure  
So get off our playground and stay away  
That's all that we've got to say  
Suzy-hang-around  
  
Yes you'd better  
Look for a friend of your own, Suzy-hang-around  
Better come back when you're grown, Suzy-hang-around  
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure  
So get off our playground and stay away  
That's all that we've got to say  
Suzy-hang-around

If you change your mind, I'm the first in line  
Honey I'm still free  
Take a chance on me  
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around  
If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down  
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown  
Honey I'm still free  
Take a chance on me  
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie  
If you put me to the test, if you let me try  
  
Take a chance on me  
(That's all I ask of you honey)  
Take a chance on me  
  
We can go dancing, we can go walking, as long as we're together  
Listen to some music, maybe just talking, get to know you better  
'Cos you know I've got  
So much that I wanna do, when I dream I'm alone with you  
It's magic  
You want me to leave it there, afraid of a love affair  
But I think you know  
That I can't let go  
  
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line  
Honey I'm still free  
Take a chance on me

If you put me to the test, if you let me try  
  
Take a chance on me  
(Come on, give me a break will you?)  
Take a chance on me  
  
Oh you can take your time baby, I'm in no hurry, know I'm gonna get you  
You don't wanna hurt me, baby don't worry, I ain't gonna let you  
Let me tell you now  
My love is strong enough to last when things are rough  
It's magic  
You say that I waste my time but I can't get you off my mind  
No I can't let go  
'Cos I love you so  
  
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line  
Honey I'm still free  
Take a chance on me  
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around  
If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down  
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown  
Honey I'm still free  
Take a chance on me  
Gonna do my very best, baby can't you see  
Gotta put me to the test, take a chance on me  
(Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)  
  
Ba ba ba ba baa, ba ba ba ba baa  
Honey I'm still free  
Take a chance on me  
Gonna do my very best, baby can't you see  
Gotta put me to the test, take a chance on me  
(Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)  
  
Ba ba ba ba baa, ba ba ba ba baa ba-ba  
Honey I'm still free  
Take a chance on me  


I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore  
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before  
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing  
Cause everyone listens when I start to sing  
I'm so grateful and proud  
All I want is to sing it out loud  
  
So I say  
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing  
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing  
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty  
What would life be?  
Without a song or a dance what are we?  
So I say thank you for the music  
For giving it to me  
  
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk  
She says I began to sing long before I could talk  
But I've often wondered, how did it all start?  
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart  
Like a melody can?  
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan  
  
So I say  
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing  
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing  
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty  
What would life be?  
Without a song or a dance what are we?  
So I say thank you for the music  
For giving it to me  
  
I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair  
I wanna sing it out to everybody  
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!  
  
So I say  
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing  
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing  
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty  
What would life be?  
Without a song or a dance what are we?  
So I say thank you for the music  
For giving it to me


Are you sure you want to hear more  
What if I ain't worth the while  
Not the style you'd be looking for  
If I'm sweet tonight  
Things look different in the morning light  
I'm jealous and I'm proud  
If you hurt my feelings I'll cry out loud  
I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry  
That's me  
  
Are you sure you want to hear more  
Would I be the one you seek  
Mild and meek like the girl next door  
Don't you realize  
I may be an angel in disguise  
It's lonely to be free  
But I'm not a man's toy, I'll never be  
I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry  
That's me  
  
I don't believe in fairy-tales  
Sweet nothings in my ear  
But I do believe in sympathy  
That's me, you see  
  
Are you sure you want to hear more  
Won't you have a drink with me  
Just to see you're not really sore  
I can't help my ways  
I'm just not the girl to hide my face  
I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry  
That's me  
  
There's a special love  
Like an eagle flying with a dove  
I'll find it in the end  
If I keep on searching, but until then  
I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry  
That's me


I must have left my house at eight, because I always do  
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due  
I must have read the morning paper going into town  
And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned  
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine  
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed  
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so  
The usual place, the usual bunch  
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained  
The day before you came  
  
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two  
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue  
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day  
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away  
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule  
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school  
The train back home again  
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then  
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame  
The day before you came  
  
I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so  
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go  
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV  
There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see  
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten  
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then  
I must have read a while  
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style  
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim  
The day before you came  
  
And turning out the light  
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night  
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain  
The day before you came


I believe your new girl turned you down  
And they say she's pushin' you around  
How does it feel, I guess it hurts your pride  
Tell me my friend how many nights you've cried  
  
Disaster and disgrace  
The king has lost his crown  
Suddenly  
He's clumsy like a clown  
The world is upside down  
The king has lost his crown  
  
Was it hard to step down from your throne  
And to know tonight you're all alone  
Oh what a shame, you really want that girl  
She doesn't care, still you just dream of her  
  
Disaster and disgrace  
The king has lost his crown  
Suddenly  
He's clumsy like a clown  
The world is upside down  
The king has lost his crown  
  
Disaster and disgrace  
The word is all around  
Suddenly  
He's clumsy like a clown  
The world is upside down  
The king has lost his crown


I've seen you twice, in a short time  
Only a week since we started  
It seems to me, for every time  
I'm getting more open-hearted  
  
I was an impossible case  
No-one ever could reach me  
But I think I can see in your face  
There's a lot you can teach me  
So I wanna know  
  
What's the name of the game?  
Does it mean anything to you?  
What's the name of the game?  
Can you feel it the way I do?  
Tell me please, 'cause I have to know  
I'm a bashful child, beginning to grow  
  
And you make me talk  
And you make me feel  
And you make me show  
What I'm trying to conceal  
If I trust in you, would you let me down?  
Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?  
Could you feel the same way too?  
I wanna know  
  
The name of the game  
  
I have no friends, no-one to see  
And I am never invited  
Now I am here, talking to you  
No wonder I get excited  
  
Your smile, and the sound of your voice  
And the way you see through me  
Got a feeling, you give me no choice  
But it means a lot to me  
So I wanna know  
  
What's the name of the game? (Your smile and the sound of your voice)  
Does it mean anything to you? (Got a feeling you give me no choice)  
(But it means a lot)  
What's the name of the game? (Your smile and the sound of your voice)  
Can you feel it the way I do?  
Tell me please, 'cause I have to know

And you make me talk  
And you make me feel  
And you make me show

If I trust in you, would you let me down?  
Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?  
Could you feel the same way too?  
I wanna know  
Oh yes I wanna know  
  
The name of the game (I was an impossible case)  
Does it mean anything to you? (But I think I can see in your face)  
(That it means a lot)  
What's the name of the game? (Your smile and the sound of your voice)

They came from the hills  
And they came from the valleys and the plains  
They struggled in the cold  
In the heat and the snow and in the rain  
Came to hear him play  
Play their minds away  
  
We're all following a strange melody  
We're all summoned by a tune  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon for him  
And we dance beneath the moon  
Sub luna saltamus  
  
They came from the south  
From the west and the north and from the east  
They waited for the man  
Like a parish is waiting for the priest  
Longed to hear him play  
Play their minds away  
  
We're all following a strange melody  
We're all summoned by a tune  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon for him  
And we dance beneath the moon  
Sub luna saltamus  
  
He gave them a dream  
He seduced everybody in the land  
The fire in his eyes  
And the fear was a weapon in his hand  
So they let him play  
Play their minds away  
  
We're all following a strange melody  
We're all summoned by a tune  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon for him  
And we dance beneath the moon  
  
And we dance beneath the moon


I hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me  
The sound so ominously tearing through the silence  
I cannot move, I'm standing  
Numb and frozen  
Among the things I love so dearly  
The books, the paintings and the furniture  
Help me  
  
The signal's sounding once again and someone tries the door-knob  
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient  
And they don't dare to come here  
Anymore now  
But how I loved our secret meetings  
We talked and talked in quiet voices  
Smiling  
  
Now I hear them moving  
Muffled noises coming through the door  
I feel I'm  
Crackin' up  
Voices growing louder, irritation building  
And I'm close to fainting  
Crackin' up  
They must know by now I'm in here trembling  
In a terror evergrowing  
Crackin' up  
My whole world is falling, going crazy  
There is no escaping now, I'm  
Crackin' up  
  
These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation  
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces  
And now they've come to take me  
Come to break me  
And yet it isn't unexpected  
I have been waiting for these visitors  
Help me  
  
Now I hear them moving  
Muffled noises coming through the door  
I feel I'm  
Crackin' up  
Voices growing louder, irritation building  
And I'm close to fainting  
Crackin' up  
They must know by now I'm in here trembling  
In a terror evergrowing  
Crackin' up  
My whole world is falling, going crazy  
There is no escaping now, I'm  
Crackin' up  
  
Now I hear them moving  
Muffled noises coming through the door  
I feel I'm  
Crackin' up  
Voices growing louder, irritation building  
And I'm close to fainting  
  
Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors)  
They must know by now I'm in here trembling  
In a terror evergrowing  
  
Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors)  
My whole world is falling, going crazy  
There is no escaping now, I'm  
  
Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors)  
Now I hear them moving  
Muffled noises coming through the door  
I feel I'm  
  
Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors)  
Voices growing louder, irritation building  
And I'm close to fainting  
  
Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors)  
They must know by now I'm in here trembling  
In a terror ever growing  
  
Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors)  
My whole world is falling, going crazy  
There is no escaping now, I'm  
Crackin' up


You and I can share the silence  
Finding comfort together  
The way old friends do  
  
And after fights and words of violence  
We make up with each other  
The way old friends do  
  
Times of joy and times of sorrow  
We will always see it through  
Oh, I don't care what comes tomorrow  
We can face it together  
The way old friends do  
  
You and I can share the silence  
Finding comfort together  
The way old friends do  
  
And after fights and words of violence  
We make up with each other  
The way old friends do  
  
Times of joy and times of sorrow  
We will always see it through  
Oh I don't care what comes tomorrow  
We can face it together  
The way old friends do  
  
We can face it together  
The way old friends do


I don't want to talk  
About the things we've gone through  
Though it's hurting me  
Now it's history  
I've played all my cards  
And that's what you've done too  
Nothing more to say  
No more ace to play  
  
The winner takes it all  
The loser standing small  
Beside the victory  
That's my destiny  
  
I was in your arms  
Thinking I belonged there  
I figured it made sense  
Building me a fence  
Building me a home  
Thinking I'd be strong there  
But I was a fool  
Playing by the rules  
  
The gods may throw a dice  
Their minds as cold as ice  
And someone way down here  
Loses someone dear  
The winner takes it all  
The loser has to fall  
It's simple and it's plain  
Why should I complain.  
  
But tell me does she kiss  
Like I used to kiss you?  
Does it feel the same  
When she calls your name?  
Somewhere deep inside  
You must know I miss you  
But what can I say  
Rules must be obeyed  
  
The judges will decide  
The likes of me abide  
Spectators of the show  
Always staying low  
The game is on again  
A lover or a friend  
A big thing or a small  
The winner takes it all  
  
I don't want to talk  
If it makes you feel sad  
And I understand  
You've come to shake my hand  
I apologize  
If it makes you feel bad  
Seeing me so tense  
No self-confidence  
But you see  
The winner takes it all  
The winner takes it all
